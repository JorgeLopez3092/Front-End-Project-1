        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've worked in the IT department for about 3 years now.  I started off doing help desk work and using WSUS to ensure that all machines were up to date.</p>
        <p>As I worked through the FSJS techdegree, I was able to pick up more and more programming responsiblities. I now work with integrating other companies with order and billing automation</p>
        <p>I use either node, which I was introduced to in FSJS, and EDI, which was easy to learn after learning node since I understood back end data processing</p>
        <p>I also integrate tech services we subscribe to that have an api into our own internal systems.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I try to have a healthy spread of hobbies that help refine both body and mind and one for relaxing such as:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Coding</li>
          <li>Gernerl Fitness</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>MMA</li>
          <li>Video Games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also enjoy going out to social events like concerts of all genres or taking weekend trips to explore different cities.</p>
